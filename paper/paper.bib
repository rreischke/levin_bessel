	abstract = {The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) provides routines to compute basic cosmological observables to a high degree of accuracy, which have been verified with an extensive suite of validation tests. Predictions are provided for many cosmological quantities, including distances, angular power spectra, correlation functions, halo bias, and the halo mass function through state-of-the-art modeling prescriptions available in the literature. Fiducial specifications for the expected galaxy distributions for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. A rigorous validation procedure, based on comparisons between CCL and independent software packages, allows us to establish a well-defined numerical accuracy for each predicted quantity. As a result, predictions for correlation functions of galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear are demonstrated to be within a fraction of the expected statistical uncertainty of the observables for the models and in the range of scales of interest to LSST. CCL is an open source software package written in C, with a Python interface and publicly available at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals. Generalizing the method of stationary phase, we expand such integrals into asymptotic series in inverse powers of the frequency. The outcome is two families of methods, one based on a truncation of the asymptotic series and the other extending an approach implicit in the work of Filon (Filon 1928 Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. 49, 38–47). Both kinds of methods approximate the integral as a linear combination of function values and derivatives, with coefficients that may depend on frequency. We determine asymptotic properties of these methods, proving, perhaps counterintuitively, that their performance drastically improves as frequency grows. The paper is accompanied by numerical results that demonstrate the potential of this set of ideas.},
