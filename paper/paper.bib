	abstract = {We present the first calculation of the cross-correlation between three-dimensional cosmic shear and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) effect. Both signals are combined in a single formalism, which permits the computation of the full covariance matrix. In order to avoid the uncertainties presented by the non-linear evolution of the matter power spectrum and intrinsic alignments of galaxies, our analysis is restricted to large scales, i.e. multipoles below l=1000. We demonstrate in a Fisher analysis that this reduction compared to other studies of three-dimensional weak lensing extending to smaller scales is compensated by the information that is gained if the additional iSW signal and in particular its cross-correlation with lensing data are considered. Given the observational standards of upcoming weak lensing surveys like Euclid, marginal errors on cosmological parameters decrease by ten per cent compared to a cosmic shear experiment if both types of information are combined without a CMB prior. Once the constraining power of CMB data is added, the improvement becomes marginal.},

	abstract = {Cosmic shear is one of the primary probes to test gravity with current and future surveys. There are two main techniques to analyse a cosmic shear survey: a tomographic method, where correlations between the lensing signals in different redshift bins are used to recover redshift information, and a 3D approach, where the full redshift information is carried through the entire analysis. Here we compare the two methods, by forecasting cosmological constraints for future surveys like Euclid. We extend the 3D formalism for the first time to theories beyond the standard model, belonging to the Horndeski class. This includes the majority of universally coupled extensions to ΛCDM with one
scalar degree of freedom in addition to the metric, still in agreement with current observations. Given a fixed background, the evolution of linear perturbations in Horndeski gravity is described by a set of four functions of time only. We model their time evolution assuming
proportionality to the dark energy density fraction and place Fisher matrix constraints on the proportionality coefficients. We find that a 3D analysis can constrain Horndeski theories better than a tomographic one, in particular with a decrease in the errors of the order of 20\{\{ per cent\}\}. This paper shows for the first time a quantitative
comparison on an equal footing between Fisher matrix forecasts for both a fully 3D and a tomographic analysis of cosmic shear surveys. The increased sensitivity of the 3D formalism comes from its ability to retain information on the source redshifts along the entire analysis.},

Predictions are provided for many cosmological quantities, including distances, angular power spectra, correlation functions, halo bias, and the halo mass function through state-of-the-art modeling prescriptions available in the literature. Fiducial specifications for the expected galaxy distributions for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. A rigorous validation procedure, based on comparisons between CCL and independent software packages, allows us to establish a well-defined numerical accuracy for each predicted quantity. As a result, predictions for correlation functions of galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear are demonstrated to be within a fraction of the expected statistical uncertainty of the observables for the models and in the range of scales of interest to LSST.

	abstract = {Accurate covariance matrices for two-point functions are critical for inferring cosmological parameters in likelihood analyses of large-scale structure surveys. Among various approaches to obtaining the covariance, analytic computation is much faster and less noisy than estimation from data or simulations. However, the transform of covariances from Fourier space to real space involves integrals with two Bessel integrals, which are numerically slow and easily affected by numerical uncertainties. Inaccurate covariances may lead to significant errors in the inference of the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we introduce a 2D-FFTLog algorithm for efficient, accurate, and numerically stable computation of non-Gaussian real-space covariances for both 3D and projected statistics. The 2D-FFTLog algorithm is easily extended to perform real-space bin-averaging. We apply the algorithm to the covariances for galaxy clustering and weak lensing for a Dark Energy Survey Year 3-like and a Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time Year 1-like survey, and demonstrate that for both surveys, our algorithm can produce numerically stable angular bin-averaged covariances with the flat sky approximation, which are sufficiently accurate for inferring cosmological parameters. The code COSMOCOV for computing the real-space covariances with or without the flat-sky approximation is released along with this paper.},

	abstract = {A collocation method for approximating integrals of rapidly oscillatory functions is analyzed. The method is efficient for integrals involving Bessel functions Jv(rx) with a large oscillation frequency parameter r, as well as for many other one- and multi-dimensional integrals of functions with rapid irregular oscillations. The analysis provides a convergence rate and it shows that the relative error of the method is even decreasing as the frequency of the oscillations increases.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals. Generalizing the method of stationary phase, we expand such integrals into asymptotic series in inverse powers of the frequency. The outcome is two families of methods, one based on a truncation of the asymptotic series and the other extending an approach implicit in the work of Filon (Filon 1928 Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. 49, 38–47). Both kinds of methods approximate the integral as a linear combination of function values and derivatives, with coefficients that may depend on frequency. We determine asymptotic properties of these methods, proving, perhaps counterintuitively, that their performance drastically improves as frequency grows. The paper is accompanied by numerical results that demonstrate the potential of this set of ideas.},
