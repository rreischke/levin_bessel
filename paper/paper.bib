	abstract = {In this paper, we explore quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals. Generalizing the method of stationary phase, we expand such integrals into asymptotic series in inverse powers of the frequency. The outcome is two families of methods, one based on a truncation of the asymptotic series and the other extending an approach implicit in the work of Filon (Filon 1928 Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. 49, 38–47). Both kinds of methods approximate the integral as a linear combination of function values and derivatives, with coefficients that may depend on frequency. We determine asymptotic properties of these methods, proving, perhaps counterintuitively, that their performance drastically improves as frequency grows. The paper is accompanied by numerical results that demonstrate the potential of this set of ideas.},
